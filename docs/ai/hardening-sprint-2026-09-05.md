# Pre-customer hardening execution note

Baseline: `ca5e9b50b05bff49d81becafe27417a1c343801c`, branch `main`, clean worktree.
No complete pre-change baseline suite was run. Production inventory, customer data, and provider
mandates are unknown; no Production/provider operation is authorized or needed
for local engineering.

Sequence: A (#1–3 creation and allocation boundaries), B (#4–8 durable billing),
C (#11,14,16 authorization and bounded analytics), D (#12,13,15,9,10,17).
Each coherent slice gets targeted tests, documentation, diff review, and a local
commit. Full gates run at milestones. No push or deployment.

## Slice A evidence and contract

- #1 confirmed: organization POST/service omits commercial state and defaults to
  LEGACY. Its client helper has no runtime caller. Canonical onboarding also
  selects LEGACY when the V2 release flag is disabled. Retire the alternate
  creation path; require enabled V2 onboarding and explicitly persist V2 plus
  the selected plan and existing once-per-owner trial. Existing legacy records
  and their deliberate Basic writable fallback stay supported.
- #2 confirmed: bulk shift deletion resolves the target by bare ID.
- #3 confirmed: manual deletion trusts arbitrary allocation IDs, permits an
  incomplete/empty set, and reads source/count outside the mutation transaction.
  Allocation creation already uses serializable transactions, including import
  execution. Deletion must participate in the same concurrency protocol.
- Preserve same-branch ownership, exact active source membership, allocation
  history, bundle representation, capacity/overlap, and at least one active shift.
- Planned tests: disabled creation, canonical V2/trial, foreign targets, invalid
  exact sets, rollback, bundles, and real concurrent allocation/deactivation.
- Evaluate branch-scoped allocation foreign keys separately from authorization;
  never guess a backfill for inconsistent historical rows.

## Approval-dependent operations

Production deployment, migrations, preflight inventory, provider actions, and
legacy data removal require separate approval. None has been performed.

## Slice A implemented and validated

#1–3 implemented, including branch-scoped allocation foreign keys. Consolidated
bulk/manual resolution and the serializable allocation transaction boundary.
Deletion preview accounts for released bundle siblings. The independent review
identified a seed caller branch mismatch and the stale capacity preview; both
were corrected and the preview has a regression test. Seed callers were updated
for the new required column; seed data was not executed or redesigned.

Validation on a newly created Docker PostgreSQL container, bound only to
`127.0.0.1:55439`, with database identity and empty initial tables verified:

- `pnpm test tests/unit/api/organization-creation.route.test.ts`: reproducer
  failed before the fix and passes (2 tests) afterward.
- `pnpm test` with the ten affected integration files: 140 tests passed,
  including raw database foreign-key and pre-change migration fixture checks.
- `pnpm test tests/integration/services/shift-hardening.test.ts
  tests/integration/services/shift.test.ts`: 27 passed after review corrections,
  including controlled post-source-read inserts and concurrent last-shift removal.
- Payment, admission flow, billing-cycle, migration and endpoint checks: 54
  passed on their combined run; the two initially failing synchronization tests
  were corrected to clear PostgreSQL's cached statistics snapshot and then passed.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: passed.
- `pnpm lint`: passed, with two warnings in generated Workflow/coverage assets.
- `pnpm build`: passed with Workflow manifest verification after sandbox rerun.
  The initial sandbox attempt was blocked by parent-directory filesystem access.
- `pnpm test:workflow`: 1 passed.
- `pnpm exec node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js validate` and `generate`:
  passed. Both `pnpm prisma` and `pnpm exec prisma` failed to resolve the local
  Windows shim, so the same installed CLI was invoked through Node via pnpm.
- `pnpm exec node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js migrate deploy`: all 40
  migrations passed from empty `lab_lords_hardening_fresh_test`; the new migration
  also applied over pre-change application data in `lab_lords_hardening_test`.
  SQL fixture tests separately prove history preservation and blocker rollback.
- `git diff --check`: passed. Broader `pnpm test`: 249 files, 1,913 tests passed.

The documented `pnpm test -- <file>` form unexpectedly ran all files with this
pnpm/Vitest combination against the deliberately unreachable new loopback target.
It was stopped; those connection failures are setup failures, not a baseline
regression result. All subsequent filtering uses `pnpm test <file>`.

## Continuation evidence

The next slice is #4–8. Read-only investigation confirms replacement provisioning
does not update the outer dispatch flag; source cancellation has no durable
processing fence; checkout retirement trusts local CREATED; reconciliation can
return stale candidate lifecycle when commercial evidence is pending; and legacy
cancellation drops the client key and reverses on local-finalization failure.
Current Razorpay lifecycle documentation distinguishes recoverable HALTED from
terminal CANCELLED/COMPLETED/EXPIRED; cancellation has no observed conditional
status precondition. Verify assumptions before modifying those paths.

Slice A was committed locally as `e5c211b`.

## Slice B dispatch hardening

#4 now records the replacement protocol before fallible provider reads, freezes
the provider scheduling tuple before dispatch, and records one-time admission
under the organization lease and exact attempt. An accepted response binds its
provider ID before local candidate finalization. Recovery through both the
service and owner API is read-only: it adopts one exact uncharged CREATED
candidate and records an immutable adopted-resolution audit. Empty discovery,
duplicates, authorized/charged objects, and old attempts without dispatch proof
remain manual review. No duplicate is automatically cancelled. New client keys
cannot bypass unresolved replacement work. A known pre-dispatch read failure
remains retryable after the existing source-state checks.

#5 has a separate source-cancellation processing attempt, expiry classification,
exact finalization fence, and immutable admission audit. Response loss, failed
local finalization, and expired workers do not resubmit cancellation. Candidate
reconciliation cannot clear that action; the immutable audit also prevents replay
after unrelated lifecycle/error fields change. Confirmed successful scheduling
is retained and repeated calls return that result. At commit `0feebe5`, ambiguous
source recovery remained unfinished. The Slice B completion below closes that
checkpoint with source-specific read-only confirmed-result recovery.

No billing schema, pricing, trial, environment, or provider configuration change.
No provider network calls were made by these tests. Existing fake Razorpay
interfaces drive real PostgreSQL fault-injection and ownership checks.

Review corrections addressed a pre-dispatch retry regression, candidate
reconciliation clearing the source fence, and a missing successful-recovery
audit. Test cleanup was fixed after a leaked method spy affected subsequent
tests; a unit transaction mock was extended for the new audit read. No test
expectation was weakened.

Validation:

- `pnpm test tests/integration/services/billing-mutation.test.ts`: 52 passed
  before adding the final successful source-cancellation control.
- `pnpm test billing`: 33 files, 398 tests passed before that final control.
- `pnpm lint`: passed, two generated Workflow/coverage warnings.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: passed after correcting a nullable
  result assertion in the new test.
- `pnpm build`: passed, including TypeScript and both import Workflow manifests;
  initial sandbox build failed on Workflow parent-directory access and the
  approved rerun succeeded with the isolated database override.
- Final `pnpm test`: **249 files, 1,922 tests passed**, including the new
  successful source-cancellation control (272.80 seconds).
- Final `pnpm test:workflow`: 1 passed.
- Final `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false` and `git diff --check`: passed.

The disposable container `lab-lords-hardening-20260905` remains available on
loopback port `55439`; the user's original `lab_lords` container was not used or
changed. Test databases created here are `lab_lords_hardening_test`,
`lab_lords_hardening_fixture_test`, and `lab_lords_hardening_fresh_test`.
Reconfirm the container and database identity before reusing them. The test
invocation used process overrides, without editing environment files:

```powershell
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55439/lab_lords_hardening_test'
$env:TEST_DATABASE_RESET_CONFIRM='lab_lords_hardening_test'
$env:ACCELERATE_URL=''
pnpm test
```

## Slice B completion

Continuation after local commit `0feebe5` completes #5–8. Source recovery reuses
an exact terminal provider source or a persisted confirmed cancellation response
plus its matching schedule. It cannot replay cancellation or use candidate
authorization to clear the source action. Since the provider API has no proven
conditional cancel-if-unauthorized operation, initial checkout retirement now
waits for provider-confirmed terminality, including when a fresh read is CREATED.
Negative candidate lifecycle is projected without granting paid entitlement;
source cancellation independently requires fresh exact candidate authorization.
HALTED does not trigger terminal deadline cleanup. Legacy cancellation preserves
the supplied client key, durable intent, and customer history without reversal.

Read-only candidate review found a CREATED authorization regression and HALTED
deadline classification; both were corrected. Regression controls cover CREATED
and AUTHENTICATED with exact authorized payments and HALTED through deadline
reconciliation. `pnpm test billing generation-migration` passed 34 files / 409
tests; `pnpm test generation-callers billing-mutation` then passed 2 files / 65
tests, including the additional CREATED control and real AI caller races.
No new billing schema or environment requirements.

## Slice C completed

#11 confirmed staff projections checked permission but not entitlement. A shared
projection now protects identities and counts on detail and settings responses.
#14 confirmed the complete AI report (including cached narrative) was reachable
without payment-view permission; the route and UI gates now require it.
#16 confirmed unbounded daily loops; real calendar-date/order validation and a
31-point limit run before all three helper loops and before route dispatch.
The limit preserves current month-to-date and 30-day UI presets. No schema,
environment or commercial policy change. Read-only review found no remaining
defect in these paths. `pnpm test trend-range ai-entitlement
branch-details-projection branchPageAccess`: 5 files / 29 tests passed, including
route 400-before-query and each helper's pre-query rejection.

## Slice D completed

#9 confirmed creation draft validation skipped null-time shifts; it now shares
canonical full-day overlap semantics. #10 confirmed live component edits could
invalidate bundle allocations; serializable updates reject component-set changes
while active allocations exist and preserve name/price/order edits. #17 confirmed
substring aliases and missing row issues; exact aliases and runtime validation
now report unsupported explicit methods, including cheque.

#12 confirmed batch-level receipt identity allowed repeated report challenge
attempts. Sender/message identity is now claimed in the challenge transaction.
#13 and #15 confirmed unfenced AI takeover and non-atomic draft publication;
branch/kind tokens, expiry checks, owned cleanup, admission cooldown and atomic
draft batches now share a small AI-specific helper. The unique draft index blocks
ambiguous historical duplicates. Gemini remains outside database transactions.

Read-only review found draft retry metadata and report takeover still followed
older timestamps. Both callers now use durable ownership/cooldown, with real
PostgreSQL caller tests proving six-minute expired report takeover, rejected
late completion, single concurrent draft generation, and GET/POST cooldown after
failed publication. The runbook requires drained old writers; mixed unfenced
old/new generation and confirmation workers are unsupported.

The additive migration applied to the isolated existing test database and all
41 migrations applied successfully to empty
`lab_lords_hardening_final_fresh_test`. Representative pre-change SQL fixtures
prove draft preservation and duplicate-blocker rollback. No environment, pricing,
trial, student dues, provider configuration or Production changes.

## Completion validation and handoff

Implementation commits after baseline `ca5e9b5`: `e5c211b` (A), `0feebe5`
(initial B fences), `9c9858b` (B completion), `6f4356b` (C), `370a13b` (D).
The final validation commit also adds the healthy-source/non-viable-candidate
control and corrects the sidebar test to require hiding the whole protected
report. All changes are local; no branch switch, push or deployment occurred.

Commands and observed results for the completed continuation:

- `pnpm test billing generation-migration`: 34 files / 409 passed.
- `pnpm test generation-callers billing-mutation`: 2 files / 65 passed.
- `pnpm test trend-range ai-entitlement branch-details-projection branchPageAccess`:
  5 files / 29 passed.
- `pnpm test billing-mutation multiShift hardening-inputs BranchSidebar`:
  4 files / 94 passed, including the final regression controls.
- First full `pnpm test`: 255 files / 1,966 tests passed; one sidebar expectation
  failed because it still expected the now-protected AI report to be visible.
  The corrected expectation passed in the targeted run above. No implementation
  protection or positive permission control was removed to satisfy the test.
- Final `pnpm test`: 255 files / 1,966 passed with no assertion failures, but
  exit 1 because Vitest timed out starting the worker for
  `generation-migration.test.ts`. `pnpm test generation-migration` then passed
  that file's two tests (exit 0). Thus all 256 files / 1,968 distinct final tests
  passed across the full attempt and isolated retry. The final full invocation
  itself was not green; its remaining failure was worker startup, not a migration
  or application assertion. A clean single-invocation CI run remains a release
  verification gate; no tests were skipped, weakened or disabled.
- `pnpm lint`: passed, zero errors and two existing unused-disable warnings in
  generated Workflow/coverage assets.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: passed after final code/test edits.
- `pnpm build`: passed, including TypeScript, static generation and both import
  Workflow manifests. The initial sandbox build failed on Workflow parent-folder
  access; the permissions rerun passed with the isolated database override.
- `pnpm test:workflow`: 1 passed.
- `pnpm exec node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js validate` and `generate`:
  passed using the installed CLI through Node because of the Windows shim issue.
- `pnpm exec node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js migrate deploy`: all 41
  migrations applied to the newly created empty local database named above.
  The new migration also applied over the existing isolated test database.
  The real SQL fixture tests preserve pre-change rows and reject duplicate
  logical drafts without deleting history.
- Local Markdown link validation: all 25 targets in the five updated canonical
  guidance/execution documents exist. `git diff --check`: passed.

Tests cover real PostgreSQL tenant constraints, transactional rollback and
concurrency, fake-provider response loss/finalization faults, report/draft stale
owners, scoped inbound identities and unchanged anniversary/later-unpaid dues.
No live Razorpay/Meta/Gemini validation, browser E2E, coverage run, Production
inventory, data cleanup, provider mutation or operational deployment was done.
The runbook contains exact schema preflights, ordering, writer compatibility,
verification and forward-repair requirements. Legacy compatibility, pricing,
trial policy, student payment generation and provider-authoritative access stay
intact. Live-checkout holds and unresolved billing manual-review states are
intentional conservative behavior, not permission to mutate provider objects.

## Findings checkpoint

All 17 findings were confirmed and fixed; none is classified as already fixed
at baseline. No local implementation finding remains open.

Razorpay HALTED is recoverable and is not treated as universally terminal.
Provider docs consulted:
[subscription states](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/subscriptions/states/)
and [cancellation API](https://razorpay.com/docs/api/payments/subscriptions/cancel-subscription/).
No documented conditional cancellation guarantee was established. Keep the
conservative live-checkout hold until provider-confirmed terminality.

The allocation migration and application require coordinated writer drain,
preflight counts, verified backfill, constraints, and deployment as documented
in the runbook. Billing protocol rollout also requires draining old mutators
and inventorying their unresolved source actions. Production inventory,
migration, operational recovery, provider mutations, and deployment all remain
approval-dependent and were not performed. No Production readiness claim is
made from local checks alone. The next highest-value work is an explicitly
approved read-only Production inventory and rollout rehearsal using the runbook;
no destructive data cleanup or legacy removal is implied.
