## 2024-03-28 - [Batch Insert Optimization in Payment Service]
**Learning:** Found an N+1 query problem where `services/payment.service.ts` loops through all students and executes `prisma.payment.create(...)` one-by-one inside a loop when generating due payments.
**Action:** Replaced the loop body with array accumulation (`paymentsToCreate.push(...)`) and executed a single `prisma.payment.createMany(...)` after the loop. This minimizes the number of database inserts significantly.

## 2024-04-01 - [Batch Insert Optimization in Branch, Onboarding and Shift Services]
**Learning:** Found N+1 query problems where `services/branch.service.ts`, `services/onboarding.service.ts` and `services/shift.service.ts` loop through arrays (shifts, seats, and seat allocations) and execute `.create(...)` and `.update(...)` one-by-one inside a loop.
**Action:** Replaced loop bodies with array mappings and `Array.from` generator, and executed single `tx.shift.createMany(...)`, `tx.seat.createMany(...)`, `tx.seatAllocation.updateMany(...)` and `tx.seatAllocation.createMany(...)`. This significantly minimizes the number of database queries during bulk actions.
