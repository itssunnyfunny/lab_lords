**Learning:** Found an N+1 query problem where `services/payment.service.ts` loops through all students and executes `prisma.payment.create(...)` one-by-one inside a loop when generating due payments.
**Action:** Replaced the loop body with array accumulation (`paymentsToCreate.push(...)`) and executed a single `prisma.payment.createMany(...)` after the loop. This minimizes the number of database inserts significantly.
