/**
 * DB ISOLATION STRATEGY: Transaction Rollback Per Test
 *
 * Why NOT deleteMany():
 *   - Cascade ordering is fragile (foreign key errors if order is wrong)
 *   - Leaves data if a test crashes mid-run
 *   - Slower (multiple DELETE queries vs one ROLLBACK)
 *
 * Why Transaction Rollback:
 *   - Atomic: either everything is cleaned up or nothing
 *   - Fast: PostgreSQL ROLLBACK is a single operation
 *   - Safe: even if test throws, afterEach still runs
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 *   - Each test gets its own Prisma client connected to a transaction
 *   - The transaction is NEVER committed
 *   - afterEach rolls it back — data vanishes as if the test never ran
 *
 * LIMITATION:
 *   - Prisma does not natively support "injectable" transactions for service-layer tests
 *   - So we use a DIFFERENT approach: truncate tables in a fixed order before each test
 *   - This is the pragmatic choice for this codebase
